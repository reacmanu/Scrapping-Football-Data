Getting Football data without Web Scrapping
Every minute of a football match generates data that can be used to get high-quality insights that could power player recruitment, and match analysis and help coaches make better decisions.

Unfortunately, most free datasets available online only contain basic stats such as goals, team names, and the day of the match.

We canâ€™t get many valuable insights with only basic stats.

To get advanced stats you could try web scraping, but before spending time on that, you could explore the data some sports data providers share for free.
